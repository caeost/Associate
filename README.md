very WIP but i think its cool, hope to work more on it.

IF THE CODE CURRENTLY WORKS YOU CAN RUN IT LIKE THIS (this is a big if):

install node.

run node in your command prompt.

*require* path to associate file e.g. if you are in the associate folder:

carl-mini:associate carlostberg$ node
> var ass = require("./associate.js");
> ass
{ getSubPrimes: [Function],
  associate: [Function],
  getAssociates: [Function],
  generate: [Function] }
> 

Do stuff (most stuff doesn't work :< )
